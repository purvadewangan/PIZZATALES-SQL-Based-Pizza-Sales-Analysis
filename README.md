## üìã Project Overview

**PIZZATALES** is a **SQL** project designed to explore and analyze real-world sales data from a pizza restaurant chain. Using **MySQL**, I examined *sales performance*, *product trends*, and *customer preferences* to <ins>uncover insights</ins> that could help drive business growth. The project highlights how well-structured SQL queries can turn raw data into meaningful intelligence for decision-making.
